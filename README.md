# Player One Now Playing Livestreaming Intergration
A project made within the scope of my university course, for the purpose of Player One as a CoP.

## Prerequisites

To run this, you must have a way to host a website on a local port (something that looks like 000.0.0.0 with actual numbers).
If you don't have your own method, or it doesn't seem to work, here's what I did;
- Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Once VS Code is installed, go to the extensions bar on the left and install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey
- Open the file called 'RunMe.html' in VS Code.
- In the bottom right corner, there should be a button called 'Go Live'. Press it and you should be launched into your browser. Copy the URL of this page.

## Usage

1. [Download the Zip of this Repository](https://github.com/DJam98/PlayerOneNowPlaying/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You can also click the green code button, then download zip
2. Now in your streaming software, create a new browser source, and place in the local host URL! Make sure the browser is set to 1920 x 1080.

#### Changing the songs

To change the songs and segments, head to the 'info.js' and change the segments and songs to what's on today!
