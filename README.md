# Player One Now Playing Livestreaming Intergration
A project made within the scope of my university course, for the purpose of Player One as a CoP.

## Prerequisites

To run this, you must have a way to host a website on a local port (something that looks like 000.0.0.0 with actual numbers).
If you don't have your own method, or it doesn't seem to work, here's what I did;
1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Once VS Code is installed, go to the extensions bar on the left and install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey
3. Open the file called 'RunMe.html' in VS Code.
4. In the bottom right corner, there should be a button called 'Go Live'. Press it and you should be launched into your browser. Copy the URL of this page.

## Usage

1. [Download the Zip of this Repository](https://github.com/DJam98/PlayerOneNowPlaying/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You can also click the green code button, then download zip
2. Now in your streaming software, create a new browser source, and place in the local host URL! Make sure the browser is set to 1920 x 1080.

#### Changing the songs

To change the songs and segments, head to the 'info.js' and change the segments and songs to what's on today!

## Contrbutions

If you'd like to help improve some of the features of this project, or you find bugs, please either create an issue (or if you have a solution create a pull request)!

If you're creating a pull request, please clearly explain what you're modifying because I am by no means the best coder on the planet.

## Libaries

The project is currently running on the p5 JavaScript libary.
